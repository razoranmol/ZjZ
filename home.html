				Pentagon Int'l College set up under the aegis of Pentagon Education Network (PEN) is affiliated to HSEB Nepal. 
				The college imparts education in three streams; Science, Management and Humanities at +2 level. 
				It has been solely conceived with a goal of  fostering and foregrounding the academia of Nepal to keep pace with the fast 
				changing pattern and cope with the global challenges and needs of the present day.
				The term 'Pentagon' derives its name from the five basic human values; truth, right conduct, peace, love and non-violence. 
				In fact, these values are the essences of human spirituality. Hence, by instilling these values into the tender and developing 
				minds of young students, the philosophy of ideal and true education can be practiced in real life.
                          	Its team comprises highly experienced, qualified and leading academic professionals and astute managers with enormous exposure
				and recognition in field of educational administration. They are capable enough to give the students the best education in their 
				fields of study. Here every one is genuinely open, friendly and helpful, making students' academic pursuit more enjoyable and 
				goal-oriented. The life of a student here is fun-filled, academically vibrant but creative and blossoming. Pentagon discourages 
				conventional approaches to teaching and embraces pragmatic and productive method. As a result, the learning teaching experience here
				 is much more active and participatory. Students learn to apply their knowledge to practical and professional values.
                       		   The college has got a prominent location in close proximity to Ring Road at Tinkune that is to say, the meeting point of 
				 three adjoining districts of the valley. The premises thus are within an easy reach for students coming from different corners.
				 Equipped with state of the art resources and amenities, it is no less on a par with international institutes. Because of these 
				exemplary features, the college turns to be a genuinely ideal centre of education characterized by its stimulating and supportive
				 environment. The constant service of its elevator is, in addition, a great comfort and convenience for the students and visitors 
				in its multistoried building.
